# Controls
The keys are as located on a QWERTY keyboard, but it should work with different layouts as well!
The gamepad buttons are indicated as on a XBox controller.

Up to four connected gamepads can be used to control the game. In the order the characters are listed here, the controls will be on the gamepad instead of the keyboard.
E.g. If one gamepad is connected the mouse will use gamepad controls and the three mechanics will use keyboard controls.
If two gamepads are connected the mouse and the red mechanic will be controlled via gamepad. And so on..

To gnaw on a machine, hold the button, while standing in the red transparent cube attached to it (the interaction zone).
To repair a machine, hold the button while carrying the appropriate tool and standing in the interaction zone.
If you are holding a tool, you can throw it by holding and releasing the corresponding button. The longer you hold the button, the further you throw!
